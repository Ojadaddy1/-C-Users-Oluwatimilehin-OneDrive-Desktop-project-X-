            <h3>Oil Changes</h3>
            <p> oil change is one of the most important and essential car maintenance items towards ensuring that your
                vehicle&apos;s engine is running properly&#46; Since oil is the lifeblood of your car&apos;s engine and
                all
                of its parts rely on it to move properly&#44; regular oil and filter change can help keep the oil clean
                and
                free of debris&#44; preventing clogging and inadequate lubrication&#46; Most mechanics and service
                stations
                will insist that you change your oil after every 3&#44;000 miles&#46; However&#44; most modern car user
                manuals
                recommend oil changes after every 5&#44;000&#44; 7&#44;500 or 10&#44;000 miles
                under
                ideal driving and environmental conditions&#46; An oil change takes about half hour in most service
                departments&#46;

            <h3>Tune-Up</h3>
            <p> Also referred to as a major service&#44; a car tune-up is a routine maintenance exercise performed on
                your
                car
                engine to ensure that it is working correctly and efficiently&#46; Tune&#8211;ups entail a thorough
                inspection of
                the
                engine where it is connected to a diagnostic analyzer&#46; The analyzer inspects the engine&apos;s
                ignition&#44;
                emission&#44; and fuel systems&#46;
                A computer scan can also be performed to examine your vehicle&apos;s electronic sensor and exhaust
                system&#46;
                Ensure
                that you perform a tune up after every 30&#44;000 miles&#46;
                While there are many other types of car maintenance services not listed above&#44; all of these services
                are
                geared towards ensuring that your car performs safely and efficiently&#46; Since most of these services
                need

            <H3>Replacing the Brake Pads</H3>
            <p> Brake maintenance is not something that should be taken lightly&#46; In the event of an emergency&#44;
                stopping
                abruptly is vital for your safety and for that of your passengers&#46; If your brakes are producing a
                screeching
                noise&#44; that means that your braking system needs maintenance&#46; If you notice this noise or any
                abnormality in
                your cars braking performance&#44; stop by at All Round for a brake inspection&#46;</p>

            <H3>Changing the Brake Fluid</H3>
            <p> When you brake&#44; you generate a lot of heat&#46; And since the brake fluid is created to endure high
                temperatures&#44; prolonged braking can raise the temperature of the brake fluid above the boiling point
                causing
                it to vaporize and potentially resulting into brake failure&#46;
                While this does not occur often&#44; it is vital to have your brake fluid replaced every one or two
                years&#46;
                Low
                brake fluid levels or failure to replace brake fluid can trigger problems with your braking system&#46;

            <H3>Tire Rotation</H3>
            <p> rotation extends the life of your tires&#46; When you drive&#44; the weight of the car distributes on
                the tires
                leaving unique erosion patterns&#46; This is uneven wear in tires is mostly due to incorrect tire
                pressure
                or
                uneven alignment&#46;
                To reduce this uneven wear&#44; it is vital to alternate your tires to different locations on your
                vehicle&#46;
                Most
                carmakers recommend rotating your tires after every 5&#44;000 to 10&#44;000 miles&#46; However&#44; it
                is crucial to
                refer
                your owner&apos;s manual for exact specifics&#46;</p>

            <h3>Car servicing</h3>
            <p> A motor vehicle service or tune&#8211;up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time
                interval or
                after the vehicle has traveled a certain distance&#46; The service intervals are specified by the
                vehicle
                manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service
                electronically
                on the instrument panel&#46; A tune&#8211;up should not be confused with engine tuning&#44; which is the
                modifying of
                an
                engine to perform better than the original specification&#44; rather than using maintenance to keep the
                engine
                running as it should&#46;</p>

            <h3>wheel alinment and balancing</h3>
            <p>Alignment refers to an adjustment to a vehicle&apos;s suspension the system that connects a vehicle to
                its
                wheels&#46; It is not an adjustment of the wheels or tyres themselves&#46; The key to proper alignment
                is
                adjusting the angles of the tyres&#44; which affects how they make contact with the road&#46;

                When checking your alignment a mechanic is mainly concerned with three things&#58;

                Camber &#8211; This is the inward or outward angle of the tyre when viewed from the front&#46; Too much
                inward or
                outward tilt&#44; also known as negative or positive camber&#44; indicates improper alignment and will
                need to
                be adjusted&#46; Worn bearings&#44; ball joints and other wheel suspension parts may also contribute to
                camber
                misalignment&#46;
                Toe &#8211; Toe alignment is the extent to which your tyres turn inward or outward when viewed from
                above&#46; To
                understand this&#44; look down at your own feet&#46; If your toes angle inward&#44; you have
                toe&#8211;in
                alignment&#59; and
                vice versa for toe-out alignment&#46;
                Caster &#8211; Your caster angle helps balance steering&#44; stability and cornering&#46; If you have
                positive
                caster&#44;
                the steering axis will tilt towards the driver.A negative caster means the steering axis tilts towards
                the front of the vehicle&#46;</p>
